    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night the sunset in the Seattle area was in rare form. You might have thought there was a <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/dcf83410c7/insane-double-rainbow-guy">double rainbow</a> by the way everyone was going on about it. My wife even noted that her Facebook feed was filled with pictures of it.</p>

<p>So I thought it would be funny to scour Twitter for all the pictures of it that I could find and post them to Facebook just to be a smart-ass.</p>

<p>I sat down to whip out a quick-and-dirty script to do this for me. By the time it was ready, I had lost the smart-ass urge to post them to Facebook, but what I ended up with turns out to be a handy little tool.</p>

<p>You can grab it from my github page at <a href="https://github.com/scottwb/twitter-image-search">https://github.com/scottwb/twitter-image-search</a></p>

<p>It's pretty easy to use. You give it a search term and it creates a directory and downloads a bunch of matching images.</p>

<p>The sunset may have passed, but this morning we have over a millimeter of snow in the Seattle area and all hell is breaking loose. It's SNOWPOCALPSE 2012!!! So, of course I ran this script:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ ./twitter-image-search.rb "seattle #snowpocalypse2012"
</code></p>

<p>And you can see from the results, people are clearly a bit worked up about the snow:</p>
