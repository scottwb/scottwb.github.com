    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just came across this test case in some old code I had forgotten about:</p>

<p>``` ruby
it "validates that the address is geocodable" do
  @user.address = "Death Star, Suite 1138"
  @user.city    = "Moon System"
  @user.state   = "Endor"
  @user.zipcode = "1138"</p>

<p>  expect{@user.save!}.to raise_exception ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid
  @user.errors[:address].should include "could not be found on the map"
end
```</p>

<p>It reminded me of something I actually think is important: have a little fun with the examples in your test cases. Not so much as to be distracting, but a little humor can add some fun to an otherwise mechanical, boring task.</p>

<p>I like to think of the guy who comes along a year later trying to understand my code by reading the tests. Telling a small story or making some pop-culture references will hopefully brighten his task.</p>
