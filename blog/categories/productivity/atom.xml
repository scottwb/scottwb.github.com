<p>I work in a team that is distributed around the country, where everyone works from their home offices. Sounds great, doesn't it? Well, it's not for everyone. First, you have to be seriously self-motivated. Personally, I get more done at home than I ever have at an office, because I get to choose when to be distracted and <em>I'm good at staying focused</em>. For some people, choosing when to be distracted is a curse. They choose to be distracted all the time. Facebook, twitter, bathroom, kitchen, twitter, kids, etc.</p>

<p>Still, some of those home distractions can plague even the most focused of us. One of the keys I've found to succesfully working from home is to have a dedicated work space. I am lucky enough to have an extra room to use as an office, and the family knows that when I'm in there, "Daddy's at work".</p>

<p>But sometimes that's not enough...</p>

<!-- MORE -->


<h3>Get Out</h3>

<p>Even when the house is empty, no co-workers are interrupting you, and you have a clear path ahead of you, the familiarity of the home office can be a distraction in itself. <em>Who's that driving down my street? I should really fix that door. I wonder if there's anything in the fridge. What time are the wife and kids coming home?</em></p>

<p>In times like these, I like to just get out and go work from somewhere else.</p>

<p>Everyone has wifi. Go to a coffee shop. Go to a pub. Go to the beach (hurray for MiFi!). Even though there is more noise and more movement, I find that sometimes just varying my surroundings can actually help me to focus. I block out the unfamiliar sounds. I expect the noise so I don't key in on every little movement. I've done some of my best out-of-the-box thinking in these kinds of environemnts.</p>

<p>This actually turns into a great perk of the distrbuted team environment. I can go work from the coffee-shop-with-a-view and it makes no difference to my co-workers. I'm still on Skype and email. I'm still checking in code and answering questions.</p>

<h3>Far Far Away</h3>

<p>So, if I can work from a coffee shop overlooking Lake Washington...what's the difference if I make it Lake Chelan? Or Miami Beach for that matter?</p>

<p>In July, I worked for 4 days from a remote part of the Olympic Peninsula. In March, to get away from the terrible Seattle weather, I worked for almost a month from South Florida. Add to that the fact that my team likes to travel to get together, and "work from home" actually becomes "work from everywhere".</p>

<p>I rather enjoy that lifestyle. The bulk of my time I'm cranking away in my home office where I am extremely productive. But every now and then, at just the right intervals, I go somewhere else to mix it up. I've even started collecting <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scottwb69/sets/72157630674264242/detail/">photos of all these places</a>. It makes for a fun reminder of one of the reasons why I like this job and working in a distributed team.</p>

<h3>Join Me, Won't You?</h3>

<p>And now for the shameless plug. My team at <a href="http://www.validas.com/">Validas</a> is ready to grow. The beauty of this is that we can recruit from anywhere - no moving expenses. Just a generous budget to deck out your home/mobile setup with the latest tech goodies, paid internet and mobile communications, and away we go.</p>

<p>So, if you're a seasoned architect/engineer, who fits our job description and wants to thrive in this work/life style, <a href="http://www.validas.com/careers/">send us your résumé today</a>. We'd love to talk to you!</p>

    <id>http://scottwb.com/blog/2012/02/13/off-the-grid-part-two</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been almost two weeks since my first <a href="/blog/2012/02/01/off-the-grid/">Off The Grid</a> post, so I figured I'd report back on how it's been going.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that I really like not being constantly distracted by growl notifications, iPhone push notifications, and little beeps vying for my attention. The biggest issue I had with constant communication connectivity was these concentration-killers. By turning off growl and push notifications, shutting down all social networking apps, and setting pre-defined times to check all these channels, I freed my mind up to focus on being creative for longer spurts.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='It seems I&#8217;m quite happy ignoring everybody for extended periods of time. '>
My biggest concern about this experiment was that I wouldn't be able to resist checking my email, Yammer, Facebook, Twitter, Google Reader, etc. every five minutes for fear of missing something time-sensitive. It turns out that was not the problem for me I thought it would be. It seems I'm quite happy ignoring everybody for extended periods of time. Knowing that I'll be checking in regularly seems to be enough to relieve any subconscious concern that I'll miss something when I don't have notifications interrupting me.
</span></p>

<p>What about those times someone needs to get ahold of me urgently? I think by not responding immediately to every email, the people around me quickly adjust their expectations. If they need to get ahold of me promptly, they use a more immediate communication channel -- like text messaging.</p>

<p>I think I'll continue in this mode. This seems like a good first step to a personal goal I made for Q1 2012: to be fluidly practicing the art of "zero inbox" by April 1. More on that later...</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow I am conducting an experiment: <em>I am going off the grid for a day.</em></p>

<p>Well, not really. But I do have a plan for taming the distractions of the internet. I am going to turn off all push notifications on my phone and all growl notifications on my desktop. I am going to keep my email client closed, shut down the Twitter app, the Yammer app, and avoid opening Facebook in my browser and phone. Maybe I'll allow Google+ because it's quieter in there than it is in my office with the door shut. My instant messenger client will be set to "do not disturb".</p>

<p>I will check email, Twitter, Facebook, and Yammer at a few specific intervals:</p>

<ol>
<li>First thing in the morning.</li>
<li>Around lunchtime.</li>
<li>At the end of the day.</li>
<li>During routine "meditation" (You know what I mean).</li>
</ol>


<p>Feel free to contact me by any of the means you normally use. Just don't expect me to respond until I do so on <em>my</em> schedule. If you need to contact me for something that is important and urgent, you can call me or text message me.</p>

<p>If you need to contact me for something that is time-sensitive, but not necessarily important, instant messenger or text message is a great way to get ahold of me. I may not respond promptly on IM, because I will have growl notifications turned off.</p>

<p>If this feels right, maybe I'll extend the experiment for a few days...</p>
