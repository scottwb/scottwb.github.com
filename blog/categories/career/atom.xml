    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/posts/2014-12-31-on-retirement/coins.jpg"></p>

<p>Over the holidays, I had a conversation with my extended family about planning for retirement. We looked at standard retirement savings formulas and some aggressive monthly savings numbers. We computed what starting an aggressive savings plan at age 40, and retiring at age 65 would look like, when you hope to live to 85 years old. That's 25 years of working and saving enough to live off of for another 20 years. It turns out that, even assuming good investment rates of return, it's pretty hard to do much better than living for 20 years on a fixed income of half your age-40 salary. That's pretty scary...</p>

<!-- MORE -->


<p>My fear is that planning for a fixed retirement income of half what I earn now seems really low <em>today</em> not to mention 25, 35, and 45 years from now..and I don’t want to live with <em>half</em> the means in 25 years. I want to live at <em>double</em>. I want to enjoy a big house where my kids and grandkids can visit, take family vacations, send my kids to college without them having to go $300K into debt, and be able to take care of my aging parents if necessary.</p>

<p>I see people from my parents' generation who retired on fixed income. While it's great that they came up in a time where you had pensions and guarantees of a certain amount of fixed income and social security, it still seems really stressful. They have the same income for the rest of their lives, it's a tight budget from day one, and their spending power decreases dramatically every year under inflation. They can't afford to fly to a family wedding, go out to eat with friends, etc. It's a weird thing to look forward to. You have this picture of retirement being a relaxation period where you can do all the things you always wanted to but couldn't because you were working...and now you have the time but you can't afford those things. Bleak picture of the twilight years, if you ask me.</p>

<p>The conclusion that I've come to accept is that <strong><em>retiring at age 65 is ridiculous</em></strong>. Not only because of what our quick-and-dirty retirement spreadsheet shows, but because of the increases in life expectancy over the last few decades and how the mind and body thrive on having a sense of purpose. I remember when my dad's dad retired (I was younger than 10, so my memory may be inaccurate) and I heard the adults saying that statistically, men who retire before age 62 die within 5 years. He didn't, but we saw how he decayed shortly after retirement. Maybe the memories of WWII had something to do with it. Maybe that’s just how everyone is at age 80. I don’t know. But I see a history of US presidents starting a presidency beyond our "normal" retirement age (Reagan was 69) and doing one of the highest-stress, most-demanding jobs on Earth for 8 more years. If the leader of the free world can work until 77 years old...</p>

<p>I think a retirement age of 65 was designed for when we had a life expectancy of roughly 65, and was meant for when you were no longer able to be a productive member of society, to give you a year or two of rest before you die. But that time span has grown from 2 years to 20 years with increased life expectancy, and our financial planning hasn't. Trying to save enough money to live comfortably for 20 years with no income seems unachievable without a windfall.</p>

<p>Scary indeed. Most industries don't hire 70-year-olds who expect higher paychecks, better health care benefits, and more vacation than kids just out of college do, especially when those twenty-somethings are seen as better investments for companies in the long run. Our employment rate doesn't seem like it could keep up with extending everyone's working years by 20 years. That leaves me with the only conclusion being that I have to <strong>OWN</strong> something — a business, investments, real-estate, something — that makes money.</p>

<p>Over my Christmas break I read Peter Thiel's new book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J6YBOFQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00J6YBOFQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sleepcodin-20&amp;linkId=FHA5UOASSDX75WZS">Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future</a></em>. There's a chapter about the difference between <em>Definite Optimism</em> and <em>Indefinite Optimism</em>. Indefinite optimism assumes that things will generally always get better, but that we just don't know how or when, so let’s just invest in things across the board and wander into the future. Definite optimism picks a goal and figures out how to make it happen, assuming we will always find a way. One example of indefinite optimism is the US economy since the 1980s, where all our growth comes from the financial sector, speculation, Wall Street, etc. As opposed to the 1940’s - 1960’s where our definite optimism saw problems and came up with answers — invent a nuke, put a man on the moon, etc. It’s amazing to think how small the budget and timeline was for putting a man on the moon compared to the indefinite expenditures and loose goals of today — decade-long oil wars for some nebulous positive outcome that may eventually happen, $19B acquisitions of messaging apps for sending each other cat pictures with no real value.</p>

<p>This all makes me think that the new way to think about retirement is to just find a problem and fix it. Make it your life's goal. It’s the only thing I can actually grasp at. I just don’t know yet what that problem is, and it still seems like a gamble...</p>

    <link href="http://scottwb.com/blog/2014/05/28/if-i-were-22/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-28T11:07:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://scottwb.com/blog/2014/05/28/if-i-were-22</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a re-post of an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140528162048-161484886-if-i-were-22-11-lessons-for-younger-me">article I published on LinkedIn</a> today.</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2014-05-28-if-i-were-22/college.jpg"></p>

<p>There's a trending topic going around on LinkedIn, where people talk about what lessons they would impart to their 22-year-old selves. "10 things I wish I had known," "10 lessons I've learned," "10 pieces of wisdom," etc. Well, mine goes to 11...</p>

<h3>1. Don't dream someone else's dream.</h3>

<p>It's very easy to get sucked into pursuing somebody else's dream. They have passion and vision and can be very convincing. Silicon Valley is built on 22-year-olds breaking their backs and pulling all-nighters to make someone else's dream a reality. At 22, I used to think, "I have plenty of time to sacrifice everything at startups and start over from scratch when I'm 30." It doesn't work that way. When the founder's dream turns into a nightmare, you're now living their nightmare with them. Statistically speaking, this is most likely how it will turn out. Pursue your <em>own</em> dreams.</p>

<!-- MORE -->


<h3>2. You're not to young to go out on your own.</h3>

<p>I wrote a letter to my grandfather when I was 16. In it, I described how I wanted to write my own story, make an impact, do something daring, and not just be a 9-5 employee the rest of my life. It seems by 22, I had forgotten that...or at least tricked myself into thinking that working for a nice salary at a startup somehow fulfilled that ambition. If it's comfortable and the only risk is your company going out of business, you're not really daring to do anything extraordinary with your career. Having started my own company now, I can tell you with certainty that I had all the tools I needed to do it when I was 22...and no wife and kids to make me think twice about the risks.</p>

<h3>3. Put it out on the line. Take risks.</h3>

<p>If you have nothing to risk, you probably have nothing to gain. Wake up young 22-year-old Scott! Just because you are working at a startup that may make it big, or may crash and burn, does not mean you are risking anything as long as you're getting a comfy salary and good benefits. Sure, you'll learn a lot and gain great experiences, but you will do that wherever you go. The only real way to elevate to the next level is because you <em>have to</em>. Stay hungry. And more importantly, realize that failure is not the end of the story.</p>

<h3>4. Don't try to be an airbrushed supermodel.</h3>

<p>Young women often grow up with body image and self-esteem issues because they compare themselves to the models on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine. As we all know, those models are all airbrushed and photoshopped. In real life even those models cannot compare to those pictures, <em>because those pictures are not real</em>. The same thing applies to entrepreneurs trying to build the next big product or business. When I was 22, everyone was talking about being "the next Microsoft". Today it's Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. These are outliers, and their successes are touted in the media until we come to believe they were overnight successes. Their stories suffer from survivor bias, and they are all "airbrushed" for public consumption. Don't get star-struck by Gates, Jobs, and Zuckerberg. Don't longingly dream of working at the perfect workplace with awesome cultures like GitHub, 37signals, Heroku, and Dropbox. Everyone's public persona is airbrushed. Blindly comparing your behind-the-scenes to their highlight reels is a surefire way to cast self-doubt and anxiety.</p>

<h3>5. You're not your job.</h3>

<p>At 22, I hadn't seen Fight Club yet. And when I did, I missed much of the point. Watch it again 20 years later and you'll see what I mean. One of the many great quotes from this movie goes like this:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet."</em> --Tyler Durden</p></blockquote>

<p>Is Charles Barkley measured by how many championships he won? No. He's measured by his <em>performance</em>, not by his teams' <em>outcomes</em>. If he was measured by his championships, he'd be a big fat zero. Instead, he's a hall-of-fame legend who's considered to be one of the best to ever play the game. And he was able to parlay that into a many other successes in life.</p>

<p>You're not your job. You're not your startup acquisition. You're not your IPO, your products, or your company. You're the sum of your experiences, the connections you make, the ethos you uphold, and the way you treat other people.</p>

<h3>6. It's all about relationships.</h3>

<p>It's been said time and time again, "It's all about who you know." There's some truth to that. The saying carries a negative stigma. Perhaps instead it should be, "It's all about who knows <em>you</em>." Make your boss look good, network with your peers, mentor your subordinates. Don't be the superhero, making sure you're always the one who comes to save the day. Let other people be heroes sometimes. <em>Help</em> them be the hero. Get out there and network, see how everyone else does it -- and respect and learn from it. Don't stay in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave">Plato's Cave</a> thinking that you're so smart you can figure out everything for yourself. There are smart people out there that you can learn from. This will pay off tenfold down the road.</p>

<h3>7. Don't associate with people that brag about their failed relationships.</h3>

<p>If the first conversation with a prospective boss involves bragging about how much of a hard-ass he was when he fired the last wave of employees because they were idiots, that's a big red flag. He's either constantly hiring idiots, or <em>he's</em> the idiot. I've known people who have never held a job for more than 6 months, and their reason for leaving is always something about how the company was mismanaged, the boss was a jerk, the team wasn't smart enough, etc.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2014-05-28-if-i-were-22/dysfunction.jpg"></p>

<p>Likewise, don't be that guy. It turns out Mom was right when she said, "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all." Ignore this advice at your own peril.</p>

<h3>8. Lifestyle is more important than money.</h3>

<p>When buying a home, they tell you the three most important factors are location, location, and location. For building your career, think "lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle." It's not to say that mastery, autonomy, purpose, money, titles, upside, coworkers, etc. aren't important...in fact, those are all factors in your lifestyle. But consider things like commuting and vacation time. How much better is your life when you can have flex time to eat breakfast with your kids, vacation whenever you want, work from anywhere in the world, and not have to waste an average of 33 hours per month sitting in traffic? Studies show that people give up 20-30% in salary for these kinds of benefits. I've made those kinds of decisions, and I believe those studies are bang on.</p>

<h3>9. Build habits intentionally.</h3>

<p>The older you get, the harder habits are to build, and the harder they are to break. Decide, while you're young, what habits you want to develop (and which you don't!) and deliberately design your <em>trigger-routine-reward</em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business-ebook/dp/B0055PGUYU/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=">habit loops</a> to set yourself up for success. In my youth habits formed unintentionally. Then, they were much harder to break when I got older. It seems the negative side-effects of bad habits are masked by youth...but they will catch up with you. Address them while it's easy.</p>

<h3>10. Choose to be healthy over being macho.</h3>

<p>My generation of software developers pioneered an odd <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brogrammer">machismo culture</a> of pulling all-nighters, drinking energy drinks, and coding 18-hours-a-day while cranking tunes and shooting each other with nerf guns. We sat in cushy high-back chairs with our feet up, and ate potato chips and fast food all day long from our limitless supplies of free sodas and snacks. The generation before me went to work at Initech 9-to-5, and lived normal work-lives like everyone else. The generation after me has their stand-up treadmill desks and exercise ball chairs. Their ergonomic keyboards, and company-sponsored gym memberships. Be more like the next generation. Bring a healthy lunch. Drink your coffee black. Drink more water. Sit up with better posture. Skip the sugary drinks and snacks. Get at least 8-hours of sleep.</p>

<p>Embrace <a href="http://chadfowler.com/passionate-programmer/burn.html">The Eight-Hour Burn</a> philosophy from the Extreme Programming movement. Work so hard and focused in 8 hours, that you could not possible output any more. Then enjoy the other two thirds of your day. You'll be WAY more productive than the 18-hour-a-day folks, who's big unspoken secret is that they still only get about 4 hours of real work done in a day. And if you work for a boss who's offended by you only working 40-hours a week, no matter how productive you are, then quit. He doesn't get it. Follow this advice and you'll be more productive, more creative, and have a longer career.</p>

<h3>11. Start saving now.</h3>

<p>When you have your first kid and start thinking about how all those get-rich-quick schemes never panned out, and those one-in-a-million startup dreams never hit it big, it'll largely be too late to start saving money for college and retirement. The beauty of compound interest is that the variable with the biggest impact is time -- and you can control it. Start early. This is one of those habits you want to form early.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it."</em> --Albert Einstein</p></blockquote>

<p>The odds of retiring off of your startup win are like the odds of winning the lottery. You need a better game plan. My dad's generation retired with millions of dollars in retirement funds because they saved from day one with pension plans. They played it safe, worked hard, earned money, saved regularly, and lived within their means. Emulating that doesn't mean not playing for the big win. It just means not being ignorant about it. Having a plan to build wealth will free your mind in ways that just might enable you to go get those big wins without worrying about having no Plan B.</p>

    <updated>2012-08-15T17:21:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://scottwb.com/blog/2012/08/15/the-joys-of-working-from-home</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scottwb69/sets/72157630674264242/detail/"><img class="left" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8022/7612882390_880e5abdc8.jpg"></a></p>

<p>I work in a team that is distributed around the country, where everyone works from their home offices. Sounds great, doesn't it? Well, it's not for everyone. First, you have to be seriously self-motivated. Personally, I get more done at home than I ever have at an office, because I get to choose when to be distracted and <em>I'm good at staying focused</em>. For some people, choosing when to be distracted is a curse. They choose to be distracted all the time. Facebook, twitter, bathroom, kitchen, twitter, kids, etc.</p>

<p>Still, some of those home distractions can plague even the most focused of us. One of the keys I've found to succesfully working from home is to have a dedicated work space. I am lucky enough to have an extra room to use as an office, and the family knows that when I'm in there, "Daddy's at work".</p>

<p>But sometimes that's not enough...</p>

<!-- MORE -->


<h3>Get Out</h3>

<p>Even when the house is empty, no co-workers are interrupting you, and you have a clear path ahead of you, the familiarity of the home office can be a distraction in itself. <em>Who's that driving down my street? I should really fix that door. I wonder if there's anything in the fridge. What time are the wife and kids coming home?</em></p>

<p>In times like these, I like to just get out and go work from somewhere else.</p>

<p>Everyone has wifi. Go to a coffee shop. Go to a pub. Go to the beach (hurray for MiFi!). Even though there is more noise and more movement, I find that sometimes just varying my surroundings can actually help me to focus. I block out the unfamiliar sounds. I expect the noise so I don't key in on every little movement. I've done some of my best out-of-the-box thinking in these kinds of environemnts.</p>

<p>This actually turns into a great perk of the distrbuted team environment. I can go work from the coffee-shop-with-a-view and it makes no difference to my co-workers. I'm still on Skype and email. I'm still checking in code and answering questions.</p>

<h3>Far Far Away</h3>

<p>So, if I can work from a coffee shop overlooking Lake Washington...what's the difference if I make it Lake Chelan? Or Miami Beach for that matter?</p>

<p>In July, I worked for 4 days from a remote part of the Olympic Peninsula. In March, to get away from the terrible Seattle weather, I worked for almost a month from South Florida. Add to that the fact that my team likes to travel to get together, and "work from home" actually becomes "work from everywhere".</p>

<p>I rather enjoy that lifestyle. The bulk of my time I'm cranking away in my home office where I am extremely productive. But every now and then, at just the right intervals, I go somewhere else to mix it up. I've even started collecting <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scottwb69/sets/72157630674264242/detail/">photos of all these places</a>. It makes for a fun reminder of one of the reasons why I like this job and working in a distributed team.</p>

<h3>Join Me, Won't You?</h3>

<p>And now for the shameless plug. My team at <a href="http://www.validas.com/">Validas</a> is ready to grow. The beauty of this is that we can recruit from anywhere - no moving expenses. Just a generous budget to deck out your home/mobile setup with the latest tech goodies, paid internet and mobile communications, and away we go.</p>

<p>So, if you're a seasoned architect/engineer, who fits our job description and wants to thrive in this work/life style, <a href="http://www.validas.com/careers/">send us your résumé today</a>. We'd love to talk to you!</p>

    <updated>2012-04-27T13:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://scottwb.com/blog/2012/04/27/my-new-home</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that I have found my new home. As of next week, I'll be starting my new position as the VP of Engineering at <a href="http://www.validas.com/">Validas</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.validas.com/"><img class="left" src="/images/validas-logo.png" title="Validas" alt="Validas"></a></p>

<p>Over the last two months, I've networked with a lot of great people and have considered opportunties at many great companies. There are so many exciting things going on in our industry, that this was not an easy decision. After taking some time to reflect, the opportunity at Validas stood out above the rest for a number of reasons.</p>

<!-- MORE -->


<p>The biggest differentiating factors were the company culture and lifestyle, and the comaraderie and ethos of the team. Earlier this month, I spent 3 days in NYC with the core members of the team. This happened to be during a big crunch time for them, with an important ship date coming just around the corner. I got to see first-hand how the team works and plays together, and how they deal with last-minute hiccups and schedule pressure. I had the opportunity to be a fly on the wall while they worked and to be included in some very interesting architecture discussions where it was clear my expertise was immediately impactful. I even got to take part in some fun PR and marketing operations with the team. I like how this team carries itself and, of all the places I've searched, I believe this is where I will feel the most at home.</p>

<p>Our team is distributed around the country, and we collaborate using all the modern online tools. Even though it's still before my official start date, I've had a chance to get my feet wet this week just for fun (and because I am too excited to hold back). I am looking forward to enjoying the work-at-home lifestyle where I already have plenty of experience and know that I can be super-productive while still being able to hit the gym and have lunch with my kids.</p>

<p>Another big attraction to Validas is that it presents the greatest opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies to solve the kinds of problems I find interesting. The volume of data we handle at Validas is enormous and growing rapidly. The huge success of our enterprise product, <a href="http://www.validas.com/solutions/vera-for-enterprise/">VERA</a>, shows that we're already the premier provider of big-data solutions in the mobile space ⎯ not to mention our forthcoming consumer-facing offerings. I see this as a great opportunity to lead the development of innovative solutions in big-data intelligence, to push the envelope in exicting areas such as machine learning and predictive analytics, and to build the next generation of consumer-facing products. The vision of this company and its founding team is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal">big, hairy, and audacious</a> - just the way I like it!</p>

<p>After being on the sideline for two months, I am chomping at the bit to get back into the game. I'm already ramping up. My first level of impact will involve applying my fresh perspective to existing systems to help find architectural solutions to the next wave of challenges. I'll also be heavily involved in building and launching some new products that have yet to be announced, so stay tuned...</p>

<p>Many thanks go out to everyone that supported me while I found my next path - especially my wife, Laurie. I rely on your support and your faith in me.</p>

    <updated>2012-03-06T12:25:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://scottwb.com/blog/2012/03/06/moving-on</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I resigned my position as CTO at <a href="http://www.balassanianenterprises.com/">Balassanian Enterprises</a>.</p>

<p>Those of you who know me know that this is <em>huge</em>. I've been working closely with the founder, Edward Balassanian, for a <em>long</em> time. It's been spread over multiple companies and an array of varying products, but it's always been a shared ethos with the same core group of people that has defined that period of my career. Leaving that behind feels a bit like an emotional breakup. Such a big part of my professional and personal identity was wrapped up in how we worked together, what we built, where we've been, and our vision of the future. We put everything into it.</p>

<p>It's also a bit like leaving home to explore new worlds.</p>

<!-- MORE -->


<p>I didn't leave because of some falling out or because of "creative differences". I think Edward and the team at Balasannian Enterprises have brilliant ideas and an exciting work environment. Some of the best minds in software development, product design, intellectual property, and creative strategy work there.</p>

<p>I left because it is time for me to do something different. My motiviation has always been driven by the pursuit of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc">autonomy, mastery, and purpose</a>. That hasn't changed. It's the way I've been going about it that needs to change. I feel the need for fresh inspiration, new relationships, and a different variety of opportunity.</p>

<p>How will I achieve that? I have no idea.</p>

<p>There are so many options; it's a bit daunting. I have some ideas that I might like to pursue on my own. I have some great contacts in the industry that are working on some really cool and <strong><em>BIG</em></strong> problems. It would be awesome to align with them. There are some exciting companies in my own backyard working on building the future and there is a vibrant, growing community of tech startups here in the Seattle area. I have a skill set that is in high demand on the contracting/consulting scene, and there's always the allure of contributing on a large scale to a meaningful open source project. That kind of networking can be fun and door-opening.</p>

<p>I've committed to taking at least a month off to let it all sink in. With an open mind, I am going to explore all avenues and opportunities before crafting the path into the next phase of my career. I'm open to all ideas! Please feel free to comment below or connect with me privately. I'd love to hear your feedback.</p>
